# Analysis
## a. Data Cleaning and Transformation:
  * **Transformation:** Given that we don't require all the columns from the table, it is advisable to cherry-pick only the essential ones. Additionally, we plan to:
    * Data cleaning by standardized datetime values for improved consistency.
    * Eliminate unnecessary columns
    * Apply more reader-friendly names.
    * Introduce new calculated columns, including Profit, Profit Margin, ShipStatus, TimeToArrive, TimeToShip, Model Name, and Customer Age for enhanced analytical insights.
     
  * **New Star Schema:**
